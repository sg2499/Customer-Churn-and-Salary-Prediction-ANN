This repository provides a comprehensive solution using **Artificial Neural Networks** (ANNs) to solve two real-world business problems:

- üîç **Customer Churn Prediction** (Classification)
- üíº **Estimated Salary Prediction** (Regression)

Both models are built, trained, and deployed with interactive **Streamlit web apps**, allowing real-time predictions based on user inputs. Additionally, the repository contains a notebook for **hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search** with Keras and Scikit-learn integration.

## üìä 1. Classification App ‚Äì Customer Churn Prediction

- **Input:** Credit Score, Gender, Age, Balance, Products, etc.
- **Output:** Churn Probability + Classification (Stay or Exit)
- **Model:** Binary Classification using ANN
- **File:** `classification_app.py`
- **Model File:** `Classification_Model.h5`

---

## üìà 2. Regression App ‚Äì Estimated Salary Prediction

- **Input:** Customer Demographics + Banking History
- **Output:** Predicted Estimated Salary
- **Model:** ANN Regression
- **File:** `regression_app.py`
- **Model File:** `Regression_Model.h5`

---

## üß™ 3. Hyperparameter Tuning

- Optimize number of neurons, layers, and epochs for the ANN

## üíæ Setup Instructions

### üîß Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sg2499/Customer_ANN_Analytics.git
cd Customer_ANN_Analytics
```

### üêç Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
conda create -n ann_env python=3.10
conda activate ann_env
```

### üì¶ Install All Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üß™ Run the Apps

#### üëâ For Churn Prediction (Classification)

```bash
streamlit run classification_app.py
```

#### üëâ For Salary Prediction (Regression)

```bash
streamlit run regression_app.py
```

---

## üìö Dataset

The dataset used is `Churn_Modelling.csv` containing customer data from a bank, including:

- Credit Score
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Credit Card and Activity Status
- Estimated Salary
- Exited (Target for classification)

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Refer to `requirements.txt`. Major packages used include:

- `tensorflow==2.15.0`
- `streamlit==1.34.0`
- `scikit-learn==1.4.2`
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- `scikeras` (for grid search)

---

## üîç Author Notes

- Both models use consistent encoders and scalers.
- All pickle files must be in the same directory as the app for successful execution.
- Hyperparameter tuning results may vary based on dataset splits and randomness.
